## 1st Step
Print screen of the page (I used a google chrome extension) and this prompt:
```
write a code in nextjs of this layout. Add the filtering system of the sidebar and copy all the pattern scheme colour and typography. Embed Google font typography and Tailwind CSS framework.
```

## 2nd Step 
It missed features and part of the layout but all the job have a look and feel modern and a good start point.

New prompt to add sidebar filtering and header.
```
This layout missed of header and subheader. The filters on the left side doesn't filter at all.
```

## 3rd Step 
The sidebar now it's working but the header and subheader are completely wrong. It completely missed the menu generation.
