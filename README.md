# NextJS Envato Theme 

This project is a test of Bolt.new code copying Envato Theme. This attempt is only created to test Bolt and how detailed it is on each iteration.

## 1st Step
Print screen of the page (I used a google chrome extension) and this prompt:
```
Write the code for this layout to generate a new nextjs project. Embed Google font typography and Tailwind CSS framework.Add the filtering system of the sidebar and copy all the pattern scheme colour and typography.
```

## 2nd Step 
It missed features and part of the layout, but all the jobs have a look and feel modern and a good starting point.

New prompt to add sidebar filtering and header.
```
This layout missed the header and subheader. The filters on the left side don't filter at all.
```

## 3rd Step 
The sidebar is working now, but the header and subheader are completely wrong. It completely missed the menu generation.
